# Vent Here Dataset - Emotion and Sentiment Analysis

## Overview

This dataset contains sentiment and emotion analysis results of venting content scraped from the Ethiopian-based Telegram channel [Vent Here](https://t.me/vent_here). The dataset provides insight into the emotional expressions and sentiments of users in the channel. The text data has been processed and analyzed using state-of-the-art NLP techniques to extract emotion and sentiment labels.

## Dataset Details

- **Source**: The data was scraped from the Telegram channel [Vent Here](https://t.me/vent_here), a community space where users express their feelings and emotions.
- **Cleaning Process**: The raw data was pre-processed by:
    - Removing emojis
    - Removing text prefixes
    - Filtering out non-English language columns to focus on English text

## Columns

- **date**: The timestamp when the venting content was posted.
- **text**: The cleaned vent text content.
- **emotion_label**: The predicted emotion label for each vent based on a RoBERTa-based emotion classification model.
- **sentiment_label**: The sentiment label (positive, negative, neutral) predicted using a sentiment analysis pipeline.
- **sentiment_score**: The sentiment score, ranging from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive), based on sentiment analysis.

## Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment for each row was extracted using the Hugging Face `pipeline` for sentiment analysis:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
sentiment_pipeline = pipeline("sentiment-analysis", truncation=True)
```

## Emotion Analysis

The emotion for each vent text was extracted using a RoBERTa-based model trained to predict various emotional labels from the text. This model categorizes text into different emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and more.

## Example Data

| date        | text                                   | emotion_label | sentiment_label | sentiment_score |
|-------------|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 2024-12-01  | "I'm feeling so overwhelmed lately"    | sadness       | negative        | -0.85           |
| 2024-12-02  | "I just had a great day with friends!" | happiness     | positive        | 0.92            |

## How to Use
