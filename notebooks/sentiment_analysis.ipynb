Just suppose that Hitler had won the war, wiped out all the Jews and convinced his people that there really was such a thing as a master race. The history books start to be changed, and, a hundred years later, his successors manage to wipe out all the Indians. Three hundred years later and the Blacks have been eliminated too. It takes five hundred years, but, finally, the all-powerful war machine succeeds in erasing all Asians from the face of the earth as well. The history books speak of remote battles waged against barbarians, but no one reads too closely, because it\\u2019s of no importance.\\n\\u201cTwo thousand years after the birth of Nazism, in a bar in Tokyo, a city that has been inhabited for five centuries now by tall, blue-eyed people, Hans and Fritz are enjoying a beer. At one point, Hans looks at Fritz and asks: \\u2018Fritz, do you think it was always like this?\\u2019\\n\\u201c\\u2018What?\\u2019 asks Fritz.\\n\\u201c\\u2018The world.\\u2019\\n\\u201c\\u2018Of course the world was always like this, isn\\u2019t that what we were taught?\\u2019\\n\\u201c\\u2018Of course, I don\\u2019t know what made me ask such a stupid question,\\u2019 says Hans. They finish their beer, talk about other things and forget the question entirely.\\u201d\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t even need to go that far into the future, you just have to go back two thousand years. Can you see yourself worshipping a guillotine, a scaffold, or an electric chair?\\u201d\\n\\u201cI know where you\\u2019re heading\\u2014to that worst of all human tortures, the cross. I remember that Cicero referred to it as \\u2018an abominable punishment\\u2019 that inflicted terrible suffering on the crucified person before he or she died. And yet, nowadays people wear it around their neck, hang it on their bedroom wall, and have come to identify it as a religious symbol, forgetting that they are looking at an instrument of torture.\\u201d\\n\\u201cTwo hundred and fifty years passed before someone decided that it was time to abolish the pagan festivals surrounding the winter solstice, the time when the sun is farthest from the earth. The apostles, and those who came after them, were too busy spreading Jesus\\u2019 message to worry about the natalis invict Solis, the Mithraic festival of the birth of the sun, which occurred on December 25. Then a bishop decided that these solstice festivals were a threat to the faith and that was that! Now we have masses, Nativity scenes, presents, sermons, plastic babies in wooden mangers, and the cast-iron conviction that Christ was born on that very day!\\u201d\\n\\u201cAnd then there\\u2019s the Christmas tree. Do you know where that comes from?\\u201d\\n\\u201cNo idea\\\"\\nSaint Boniface decided to \\u2018christianize\\u2019 a ritual intended to honor the god Odin when he was a child. Once a year, the Germanic tribes would place presents around an oak tree for the children to find. They thought this would bring joy to the pagan deity.\\u201d\\n\\u201cGoing back to the story of Hans and Fritz: do you think that civilization, human relations, our hopes, our conquests, are all just the product of some other garbled story?\\u201d\\nEna min lemalet felge new... instead of acting all holier than thou and instead of being proud of a race, a religion , parents, ethnicity we didn't choose..we had no say in..its better to think and come to ur own conclusions...\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Hey Unihorse \\ud83e\\udd84.\\nHide My Identity.\\nI need to vent.\\nHeyy guys i need to vent my problem is there is this guy i love like not the kinda  love most ppl expreince dis days I LOVE HIM so dz he but i broke up with him cause my mom always want me to marry a guy the status as me....we r kinda rich.....but my ex has literally nth he is the kinda Person u will call really poor nd my mom rly dnt want that nd i cant make her feel sad bc of me but at same time rn am so depressed nd sad bc i miss him.....idk wat to do if i have to be with him nd  decive my family or live like this hurt....pls i need real advice bcuzi tried wiz other guys but it couldnt work out for me cuz my heart is still with him.....HELP\\n\",\n          \"Hey Unihorse \\ud83e\\udd84.\\nHide My Identity.\\nI need to vent.\\nHello unihorse \\nHide my identity\\nI rather say i wanted to say something than vent. so here its \\nWhy do you think most of us peoples are unhappy why are we so intimidated that bad things will happen to us? you know why, its because we tend to think the negative things than the positives we tend to think the odds we fear i read something earlier about how our mind get used to the thing you think and when ever you start doing something new it always send you the fearfull thoughts and push you to step back  this is totally not our fault its either how we grow up or disastrous things that happened to us before and how we deal with it...but now my point is how can we face our fears ? How can we go for it ? There are lots of books that might  influence you and stuff but I suggest you the best ever method you could use.... its God follow his word do his will you have no idea how peacefull and happy you will be what ever religion you're in ,look deeper in your religion and connect with god your soul will be renewed u'll feel some power inside of you that makes you wash away your fears and work hard, trust me this is the best ever medicen you'll get it worked for me may it work for you \\n   Peace\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Just suppose that Hitler had won the war, wiped out all the Jews and convinced his people that there really was such a thing as a master race. The history books start to be changed, and, a hundred years later, his successors manage to wipe out all the Indians. Three hundred years later and the Blacks have been eliminated too. It takes five hundred years, but, finally, the all-powerful war machine succeeds in erasing all Asians from the face of the earth as well. The history books speak of remote battles waged against barbarians, but no one reads too closely, because it\\u2019s of no importance.\\n\\u201cTwo thousand years after the birth of Nazism, in a bar in Tokyo, a city that has been inhabited for five centuries now by tall, blue-eyed people, Hans and Fritz are enjoying a beer. At one point, Hans looks at Fritz and asks: \\u2018Fritz, do you think it was always like this?\\u2019\\n\\u201c\\u2018What?\\u2019 asks Fritz.\\n\\u201c\\u2018The world.\\u2019\\n\\u201c\\u2018Of course the world was always like this, isn\\u2019t that what we were taught?\\u2019\\n\\u201c\\u2018Of course, I don\\u2019t know what made me ask such a stupid question,\\u2019 says Hans. They finish their beer, talk about other things and forget the question entirely.\\u201d\\n\\u201cYou don\\u2019t even need to go that far into the future, you just have to go back two thousand years. Can you see yourself worshipping a guillotine, a scaffold, or an electric chair?\\u201d\\n\\u201cI know where you\\u2019re heading\\u2014to that worst of all human tortures, the cross. I remember that Cicero referred to it as \\u2018an abominable punishment\\u2019 that inflicted terrible suffering on the crucified person before he or she died. And yet, nowadays people wear it around their neck, hang it on their bedroom wall, and have come to identify it as a religious symbol, forgetting that they are looking at an instrument of torture.\\u201d\\n\\u201cTwo hundred and fifty years passed before someone decided that it was time to abolish the pagan festivals surrounding the winter solstice, the time when the sun is farthest from the earth. The apostles, and those who came after them, were too busy spreading Jesus\\u2019 message to worry about the natalis invict Solis, the Mithraic festival of the birth of the sun, which occurred on December 25. Then a bishop decided that these solstice festivals were a threat to the faith and that was that! Now we have masses, Nativity scenes, presents, sermons, plastic babies in wooden mangers, and the cast-iron conviction that Christ was born on that very day!\\u201d\\n\\u201cAnd then there\\u2019s the Christmas tree. Do you know where that comes from?\\u201d\\n\\u201cNo idea\\\"\\nSaint Boniface decided to \\u2018christianize\\u2019 a ritual intended to honor the god Odin when he was a child. Once a year, the Germanic tribes would place presents around an oak tree for the children to find. They thought this would bring joy to the pagan deity.\\u201d\\n\\u201cGoing back to the story of Hans and Fritz: do you think that civilization, human relations, our hopes, our conquests, are all just the product of some other garbled story?\\u201d\\nEna min lemalet felge new... instead of acting all holier than thou and instead of being proud of a race, a religion , parents, ethnicity we didn't choose..we had no say in..its better to think and come to ur own conclusions...\\\"\\n\",\n          \"Hey Unihorse \\ud83e\\udd84.\\nHide My Identity.\\nI need to vent.\\nHeyy guys i need to vent my problem is there is this guy i love like not the kinda  love most ppl expreince dis days I LOVE HIM so dz he but i broke up with him cause my mom always want me to marry a guy the status as me....we r kinda rich.....but my ex has literally nth he is the kinda Person u will call really poor nd my mom rly dnt want that nd i cant make her feel sad bc of me but at same time rn am so depressed nd sad bc i miss him.....idk wat to do if i have to be with him nd  decive my family or live like this hurt....pls i need real advice bcuzi tried wiz other guys but it couldnt work out for me cuz my heart is still with him.....HELP\\n\",\n          \"Hey Unihorse \\ud83e\\udd84.\\nHide My Identity.\\nI need to vent.\\nHello unihorse \\nHide my identity\\nI rather say i wanted to say something than vent. so here its \\nWhy do you think most of us peoples are unhappy why are we so intimidated that bad things will happen to us? you know why, its because we tend to think the negative things than the positives we tend to think the odds we fear i read something earlier about how our mind get used to the thing you think and when ever you start doing something new it always send you the fearfull thoughts and push you to step back  this is totally not our fault its either how we grow up or disastrous things that happened to us before and how we deal with it...but now my point is how can we face our fears ? How can we go for it ? There are lots of books that might  influence you and stuff but I suggest you the best ever method you could use.... its God follow his word do his will you have no idea how peacefull and happy you will be what ever religion you're in ,look deeper in your religion and connect with god your soul will be renewed u'll feel some power inside of you that makes you wash away your fears and work hard, trust me this is the best ever medicen you'll get it worked for me may it work for you \\n   Peace\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
